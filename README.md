This is the most basic demonstration application made with Object Reef&reg; technology. Although it is very simple and does not contain much source code, it meets the requirements of a complete and functional service. The sample is released under the terms of the MIT license, the content of which you can find [here](./LICENSE.md).

**NOTE:** This is only frontend part of the application. Backend source code you can find at [https://github.com/HumanDialog/checklists.reef](https://github.com/HumanDialog/checklists.reef)
